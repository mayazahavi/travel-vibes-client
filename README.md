# Travel Vibes

## What the site is about

Travel Vibes is a website that helps users plan trips based on their travel preferences. Users can select their travel vibe, search for destinations, and create personalized trips.

## The 3 required pages

1. **Content Page** - VibesPage (src/pages/VibesPage.jsx)
2. **Form Page** - CreateTripPage (src/pages/CreateTripPage.jsx)
3. **API Page** - ExplorePage (src/pages/ExplorePage.jsx)

**Note:** I also created a HomePage (src/pages/HomePage.jsx) as a landing page to improve user experience and navigation, even though it wasn't required by the assignment guidelines.
